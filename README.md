Red Team's SIEM - tool for Red Teams for tracking and alarming about Blue Team activities as well as enhanced usability in long term operations.

1. **Enhanced usability and overview** for the red team operators by creating a central location where all relevant _operational_ logs from multiple teamservers are collected and enriched. This is great for historic searching within the operation as well as giving a read-only view on the operation (e.g. for the White Team). Especially useful for multi-scenario, multi-teamserver, multi-member and multi-month operations. Also, super easy ways for viewing all screenshots, IOCs, keystrokes output, etc. \o/
2. **Spot the Blue Team** by having a central location where all _traffic_ logs from redirectors are collected and enriched. Using specific queries its now possible to detect that the Blue Team is investigating your infrastructure.
